# Bendight

This is a two player game with two different roles :
  - The dodger is moves faster and tries to survive for 1 minute
  - The shooter tries to hit the dodger 5 times in less than 1 minute. He has a weapon than can shoot bullets and curve their trajectories

If you just want to test the game, you can download the Bendight.zip file at the root of the project and get started. 
(It is not possible to play alone so you have to find a friend or start the game twice)

# Source code

This game was made using Unity 5.5 but opening it and building it with the new 2017.1 version seemed to work fine.

To test alone, you can press ctrl+G while in the editor. 
It should build the game, start a version on the built game and start the game in the editor.
